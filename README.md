## Contributing

Fork the project on github.

Create a feature branch.

Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using CMD+Option+L (Reformat code) on Mac (not sure for Windows) with Android Studio defaults.

Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge.

Pull requests must be made against development branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.

Have fun!
